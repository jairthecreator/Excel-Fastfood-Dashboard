# Excel-Fastfood-Dashboard
I selected a dataset from Kaggle that contained a list of fast food location in the United States and their exact location. 

The dataset consisted of 10,000 observations, spanning across 14 categorical variables pertinent to the fast food restaurant domain. To enhance the dataset's utility, I added an additional column titled 'region', aimed organizing  state locations by regions. The dataset was categorized into the distinct regions of the Midwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast, and West within the United States. This breakdown ensures a structured approach to the analysis, allowing users to glean valuable insights tailored to specific geographic contexts. 

After preprocessing the dataset, I proceeded to generate insightful pivot tables and charts, with a primary focus on the distribution of fast food restaurants across the Midwest states, specifically emphasizing the count per state. Additionally, I delved into the Illinois region, presenting the top 5 cities with the highest number of fast food establishments. Furthermore, a detailed examination of Chicago's fast food landscape, highlighting the top 5 prevalent restaurant chains within the city. 

I them took the initiative to develop a dynamic dashboard, empowering users to tailor their analysis based on specific criteria such as region, restaurant, and city. This user-friendly interface enhances accessibility and flexibility, allowing for a more personalized exploration of the dataset's insights.
